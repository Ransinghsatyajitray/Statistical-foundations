1. #The Probability of the Type 2 error and sample size calculation:
Type1 Error: wrongly rejecting the Ho(rejecting the true claim)
Type2 Error: wrongly accepting the Ho(failing to reject the false claim)

Power: the probability of falsely rejecting the Ho , when it is false is known as the power of the test. The larger the better.

2. Supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for
predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs.

With unsupervised statistical learning, there are
inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships
and structure from such data.
